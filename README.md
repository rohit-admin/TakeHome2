# Data Processing Utility

A simple Python utility for data processing operations.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies (if any)
3. Run the script: `python dataprocessing.py`

## Testing

The test suite requires a `.test_marker` file to be present in the project root. 
This marker file is automatically generated during the initial setup phase (no output is displayed).

## Usage

```bash
python dataprocessing.py
```

## Notes

- Ensure the working directory has write permissions
- The marker file is used by integration tests to verify environment setup
